# Tacokit Sandbox

The Tacokit Sandbox, hosted on Heroku, is useful for demonstrating the
OAuth flow with Trello. It also provides an endpoint for testing Trello
webhook callbacks.

Visit [Tacokit Sandbox](https://tacokit.herokuapp.com) and enter your Trello
app key and secret and connect with Trello to retrieve your OAuth credentials.

This is Taco.
